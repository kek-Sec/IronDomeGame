//
// This is a great place to put global configuration and
// behavior that modifies Cypress.
//
// You can change the location of this file or turn off
// automatically serving support files with the
// 'supportFile' configuration option.
//
// You can read more here:
// https://on.cypress.io/configuration
//
// You can also import other files to be included in the test bundle:
// import './commands'

// For now, this file can be empty. Its presence is enough to
// satisfy the Cypress runner.
